=======
General
=======

Tarsnap GUI is built using the Qt SDK for cross platform compatibility. In order to build
Tarsnap GUI for your system, you must first install the appropriate Qt 5 SDK on your system.
Latest recommonded version for optimal results and platform support is Qt 5.4.0 or greater.

First step for all platforms is to install the Tarsnap client:

Once you have the Tarsnap client installed on your machine proceed to the following:

=======
FreeBSD
=======

KDE Desktop
-----------
Last tested on FreeBSD 10.1 with Qt version Qt 5.3.2 and KDE 4.14.2.

1) pkg install git qt5-core qt5-widgets qt5-qmake qt5-network qt5-buildtools qt5-sql qt5-sqldrivers-sqlite3
2) git clone https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git && cd tarsnap-gui
3) git checkout v0.5 # switch to the desired version
4) /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
5) Edit the resulted Makefile and append ",-L,/usr/local/lib" to the LFLAGS line. Somehow
the clang++ spec of qmake ommits that on FreeBSD. The complete line should look like this:
LFLAGS        = -pthread -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib,-L,/usr/local/lib
6) make
7) ./tarsnap-gui

GNOME Desktop
-------------

=============
OS X Yosemite
=============



====================
Debian based distros
====================

These steps apply to all the Debian(included) based flavors and have been tested on these distros
so far:

* Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid
* Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS Trusty
* Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon

All of them seem to include the Qt5 SDK in the official main repos.

1) sudo apt-get install g++ git qtbase5-dev
2) git clone https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git && cd tarsnap-gui
3) git checkout v0.5 # switch to the desired version
4) export QT_SELECT=qt5
5) qmake && make -j$(nproc)
6) ./tarsnap-gui

=====================
Red Hat based distros
=====================

No specific testing has been done on Fedora, CentOS and the likes. Though adapting the package
manager step(to rpm) and looking for the proper Qt5 packages to install should be the only
difference.
