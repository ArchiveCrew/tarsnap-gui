Version 0.7
-----------

New features:
* Skip files from backup using shell globbing patterns. This option is
available as a global setting (for excluding system junk files for example) and
as a Job specific option.
* Add system notifications. They are shown in both normal and headless mode.
They can be disabled in Settings.
* Add option in wizard advanced page to ensure settings are stored in INI
format.
* Add --appdata command line option. Useful for multiple configurations on the
same machine (INI format is implied).
* Ability to grab the Tarsnap credit from the website. User and password is
required and are transmitted over https. Password is used only once and is not
stored.
* Detect Tarsnap client version and use it to discriminate features
availability.
* Look for existing keys and prompt them to the user when in setup wizard.

Improvements and fixes:
* Added DB upgrade mechanism. Version updates will go smooth from now on.
* Redesigned the Job details widget to be more efficient and intuitive.
* 99% of the UI looks gorgeous in high res/dpi displays now.
* Archive removal from the UI upon delete is now lazy fashioned.
* Archive sync between the local store and the remote has been greatly
improved. You should experience less discrepancies than before.
* Archives get automagically re/assigned to Jobs based on job prefixes upon
sync from remote.
* Fixed various UI update issues between Archives and Jobs tabs when archives
are being manipulated.
* Improved error journal and log messages.
* Many performance and stability concerns have been fixed or improved. A slew
of UI annoyances and bugs have also been fixed.

Caveats:
* Some internally used settings keys have been renamed for consistency and upon
upgrading from an older version the setup wizard dialog will pop up. Follow the
prompts and select "Yes" when asked if you have used Tarsnap on this machine in
the past and have a key. Select the previous key if available in the dropdown
list or locate it manually and proceed. You jobs and settings should remain
unchanged.

Version 0.6
-----------

Improvements and fixes:
* Add About widget and menubar entry in conformity with Apple's HID guidelines.
* Add command line arguments -h and -v; needed for OS X Homebrew consideration.
* Automatic job backups via the --jobs command argument. Can be used with cron
scheduling or otherwise. There's a job specific option 'Include in scheduled
backups' that controls which jobs will get executed.
* Added ability to cancel any running operation by clicking on the busy icon.
* Tristate checkboxes in the FilePicker file system tree view. Partially
checked directories signify a partial selection of child items.
* Visually indicate archives pertaining to a job in the Archives pane.
* Upgraded the Add job button looks and functionality. Has a dropdown menu with
'Backup all jobs' action.
* Display cached archives on startup until the remote sync has completed.
* Ctrl+j toggles the Journal log widget now.
* Purge operation now requires typing the 'No Tomorrow'; similar to CLI.
* Add some extra confirmations as safety checks when deleting archives in bulk.
* Implement proper access locking to the Sqlite DB. Should fix any concurrent
access issues.
* Various other improvements and fixes, including some based on the feedback
following the v0.5 release.

Caveats:
* The Sqlite DB schema has changed. It's best to reset the app settings before
upgrading to the new version using the Settings -> Run Setup Wizard
functionality. You need to recreate your Jobs following the upgrade. Next
release will include a DB update method.
