Version 0.9
-----------

New features:

* Added ability to download an archive as a tar file. This option is available
in the restore dialog window.
* You can now review your account and machine activity logs via the Settings ->
Account page. Tarsnap login is required just like with credit. I recommend you
upgrade Tarsnap CLI to 1.0.37 for optimal results.
* Added ability to gracefully interrupt running backups from stop tasks dialog,
by sending SIGQUIT to Tarsnap CLI. The current archive creation will be
truncated and '.part' is appended to the archive name.
* On vanilla configuration the app now offers to add default Jobs for common
home directories like Desktop, Pictures and Documents.
* You can now quickly create a Job from the current Backup list using the
Backup button drop-down.
* Added bandwidth limiting settings for upload and download rates in
Settings -> Application.
* Added Home button to the File Browser that when clicked quickly jumps the
browse tree to the user's home directory.
* Homebrew is now the preferred installation method for OS X. Port and pkg's are 
available for FreeBSD too. See INSTALL dist file. 

Improvements and fixes:
* Made SI notation default in the UI with option to switch to IEC.
* Added more useful keyboard shortcuts for the actions available in the Archives
and Jobs lists.
* Beautified the restore dialog widget. Improvements for the Restore
functionality.
* Archives that are queued for deletion are now disabled in the Archive lists
until the operation has concluded.
* Significant improvements to the Setup Wizard. The dialog should now be even
easier to follow, with one step removed.
* Made Console Log easier to read.
* Improvements to CLI version detection.
* Support for highres/density displays is now 99% complete.
* Overall, the app is leaner, better looking and faster due to various
refactorings and improvements.
* Many bugs, leaks, UI issues and other inconsistencies have now been resolved.
The app is now more robust than ever.

I've also written a tutorial on getting started with Tarsnap GUI for OS X
available at http://shinnok.com/rants/2016/02/19/using-tarsnap-gui-on-os-x/.

Version 0.8
-----------

New features:
* Add Homebrew recipe for easy installation on OS X.
* The app can now be opened from headless operation, by clicking on
notification icon or messages.
* Upgrade the task cancel functionality. Now, one can either clear the queued
tasks, stop the running ones or both.
* Implement Simulation mode with the help of --dry-run. No new archives will be
uploaded to the Tarsnap servers while this mode is on. The option is available
in Settings -> Advanced. Disabling simulation mode or refreshing the Archives
list will roll back all new archives and stats. Simulation mode is conveniently
flagged while active with a bolt icon close to the busy indicator in the status
bar.
* Implement nodump global and per job setting. When enabled, files flagged as
nodump in the file system will be skipped when backing up.
* Implement ignore default tarsnap configs option (tarsnap.conf and tarsnaprc),
using tarsnap --no-default-config parameter.
* The app now features a persistent Journal log. All your tarsnap actions in
either normal or headless operation are stored and available for later review.
The Journal can be cleared in Settings -> Advanced.

Improvements and fixes:
* Use monospaced fixed width fonts for increased readability of Journal and
Console logs as well other places where it made sense and text align nicely.
* Upgraded the Qt signal slot connect syntax. For end users, performance is the
main gain from this.
* Cache archive contents as compressed (zlib) blobs and only decompress when
needed for display. This significantly reduces overall memory usage, Sqlite DB
size on disk and in memory and greatly increases the app's performance overall.
* Improved error handling for several cases, among them cache errors are now
gracefully handled.
* Overall, the app is leaner, better looking and faster due to various
refactorings and C++11/14 adoption.
* Many bugs, UI issues and other inconsistencies have now been resolved.

Version 0.7
-----------

New features:
* Skip files from backup using shell globbing patterns. This option is
available as a global setting (for excluding system junk files for example) and
as a Job specific option.
* Add system notifications. They are shown in both normal and headless mode.
They can be disabled in Settings.
* Add option in wizard advanced page to ensure settings are stored in INI
format.
* Add --appdata command line option. Useful for multiple configurations on the
same machine (INI format is implied).
* Ability to grab the Tarsnap credit from the website. User and password is
required and are transmitted over https. Password is used only once and is not
stored.
* Detect Tarsnap client version and use it to discriminate features
availability.
* Look for existing keys and prompt them to the user when in setup wizard.

Improvements and fixes:
* Added DB upgrade mechanism. Version updates will go smooth from now on.
* Redesigned the Job details widget to be more efficient and intuitive.
* 99% of the UI looks gorgeous in high res/dpi displays now.
* Archive removal from the UI upon delete is now lazy fashioned.
* Archive sync between the local store and the remote has been greatly
improved. You should experience less discrepancies than before.
* Archives get automagically re/assigned to Jobs based on job prefixes upon
sync from remote.
* Fixed various UI update issues between Archives and Jobs tabs when archives
are being manipulated.
* Improved error journal and log messages.
* Many performance and stability concerns have been fixed or improved. A slew
of UI annoyances and bugs have also been fixed.

Caveats:
* Some internally used settings keys have been renamed for consistency and upon
upgrading from an older version the setup wizard dialog will pop up. Follow the
prompts and select "Yes" when asked if you have used Tarsnap on this machine in
the past and have a key. Select the previous key if available in the dropdown
list or locate it manually and proceed. You jobs and settings should remain
unchanged.

Version 0.6
-----------

Improvements and fixes:
* Add About widget and menubar entry in conformity with Apple's HID guidelines.
* Add command line arguments -h and -v; needed for OS X Homebrew consideration.
* Automatic job backups via the --jobs command argument. Can be used with cron
scheduling or otherwise. There's a job specific option 'Include in scheduled
backups' that controls which jobs will get executed.
* Added ability to cancel any running operation by clicking on the busy icon.
* Tristate checkboxes in the FilePicker file system tree view. Partially
checked directories signify a partial selection of child items.
* Visually indicate archives pertaining to a job in the Archives pane.
* Upgraded the Add job button looks and functionality. Has a dropdown menu with
'Backup all jobs' action.
* Display cached archives on startup until the remote sync has completed.
* Ctrl+j toggles the Journal log widget now.
* Purge operation now requires typing the 'No Tomorrow'; similar to CLI.
* Add some extra confirmations as safety checks when deleting archives in bulk.
* Implement proper access locking to the Sqlite DB. Should fix any concurrent
access issues.
* Various other improvements and fixes, including some based on the feedback
following the v0.5 release.

Caveats:
* The Sqlite DB schema has changed. It's best to reset the app settings before
upgrading to the new version using the Settings -> Run Setup Wizard
functionality. You need to recreate your Jobs following the upgrade. Next
release will include a DB update method.
