Version 0.6
-----------

Improvements and fixes:

* Add About widget and menubar entry in conformity with Apple's HID guidelines.
* Add command line arguments -h and -v; needed for OS X Homebrew consideration.
* Automatic job backups via the --jobs command argument. Can be used with cron
  scheduling or otherwise. There's a job specific option 'Include in scheduled
  backups' that controls which jobs will get executed.
* Added ability to cancel any running operation by clicking on the busy icon.
* Tristate checkboxes in the FilePicker file system tree view. Partially checked
  directories signify a partial selection of child items.
* Visually indicate archives pertaining to a job in the Archives pane.
* Upgraded the Add job button looks and functionality. Has a dropdown menu with
  'Backup all jobs' action.
* Display cached archives on startup until the remote sync has completed.
* Ctrl+j toggles the Journal log widget now.
* Purge operation now requires typing the 'No Tomorrow'; similar to CLI.
* Add some extra confirmations as safety checks when deleting archives in bulk.
* Implement proper access locking to the Sqlite DB. Should fix any concurrent
  access issues.
* Various other improvements and fixes, including some based on the feedback
  following the v0.5 release.

Caveats:
* The Sqlite DB schema has changed. It's best to reset the app settings before
upgrading to the new version using the Settings -> Run Setup Wizard
functionality. You need to recreate your Jobs following the upgrade. Next
release will include a DB update method.
